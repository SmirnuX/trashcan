# Game theory
 
[link](/game_theory)

 Simple realization of iterative method of solving antagonistic games.

 # Tipa CFS
 
[link](/tipa_CFS)

 Attempt to model Linux CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler). Not stable, working on old version of QT and probably isn't correct. 


 # Weiler Cut

[link](/Weiler_cut)

 Simple app to test Weiler Atherton polygon clipping algorithm. It was meant to be included in [crystalls](https://github.com/SmirnuX/crystalls), but in current version it's too buggy.
